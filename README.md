The Movie Recommender Bot is a Python-based application that suggests movies to users based on their preferred genre. This project demonstrates the integration of web scraping, data processing, and automation to build a functional recommendation system. The bot uses Scrapy to scrape real-time movie data from the web, processes and organizes the information with Pandas, and presents genre-specific recommendations directly to the user.
